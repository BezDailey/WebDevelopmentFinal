                <h1>What is Life Path One?</h1>
                <!--Paragraph One-->
                <p>
                    A person with Life Path number 1 is hard working, a natural born leader, has a pioneering spirit that 
                    is full of energy, and a passion for art. They have a strong desire to be number one, which means a 
                    person with this number can manifest very easily. Due to their determination and self motivation, they 
                    won't let anything stand in their way of accomplishing a goal. Their drive allows them to overcome any 
                    obstacle or challenge they may encounter, and they have the desire to accomplish great things in their 
                    lifetime. Their only need is to focus on what they want in order to achieve it.
                </p>
                <!--Paragraph Two-->
                <p>
                    People with Life Path 1 are very independent and feel the need to make up their own mind about 
                    things and follow their own personal convictions. All this drive and determination means that 
                    they can easily become irritated when things don't go their way. 
                </p> 
                <!--Paragraph Three-->
                <p>
                    Because Ones are critical of themselves, they can also be very critical of others. The Ones 
                    will not tolerate laziness from the people they spend their time with.
