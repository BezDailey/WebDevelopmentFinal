                    <h1>What is Numerology?</h1>
                    <!--Paragraph One-->
                    <p>Pythagoras and other philosophers of the time believed that because mathematical concepts were more 
                        "practical" (easier to regulate and classify) than physical ones, they had greater actuality. St. 
                        Augustine of Hippo (A.D. 354â€“430), wrote: "Numbers are the Universal language offered by the deity 
                        to humans as confirmation of the truth." Similar to Pythagoras, he too believed 
                        that everything had numerical relationships and it was up to the mind to seek and investigate the 
                        secrets of these relationships or have them revealed by divine grace. See Numerology and the Church 
                        Fathers for early Christian beliefs on the subject.</p>
                    <!--Paragraph Two-->
                    <p>In 325 AD, following the First Council of Nicaea, departures from the beliefs of the state church 
                        were classified as civil violations within the Roman Empire. Numerology had not found favor with the 
                        Christian authority of the day and was assigned to the field of unapproved beliefs along with astrology 
                        and other forms of divination and "magic". Despite this religious purging, the spiritual 
                        significance assigned to the heretofore "sacred" numbers had not disappeared; several numbers, such as 
                        the "Jesus number" have been commented and analyzed by Dorotheus of Gaza and numerology still is used 
                        at least in conservative Greek Orthodox circles. However, despite the church's resistance to 
                        numerology, there have been arguments made for the presence of numerology in the Bible and religious architecture. For example, 
                        the numbers 3 and 7 hold strong spiritual meaning in the Bible. The most obvious example would be the creation 
                        of the world in 7 days. Jesus asked God 3 times if he could avoid crucifixion and was crucified at 3 in the 
                        afternoon. 7 is the length of famine and other God-imposed events and is sometimes followed by the number 8 as a symbol of change.</p> 
                    <!--Paragraph Three-->
                    <p>Modern numerology has various antecedents. Ruth A. Drayer's book, Numerology, The Power in Numbers says 
                        that around the start of the 20th century Mrs. L. Dow Balliett combined Pythagoras' work with Biblical 
                        reference. Balliett's student, Juno Jordan, helped numerology become the system known today as 
                        Pythagorean, although Pythagoras himself had nothing to do with the system, by publishing "The Romance in Your 
                        Name" in 1965, provided a system for identifying what he called key numerological influences in names and birth 
                        dates that remains used today. Other 'numerologists' including Florence Campbell (1931), Lynn Buess (1978), 
                        Mark Gruner (1979), Faith Javane and Dusty Bunker (1979), Kathleen Roquemore (1985) expanded on the use of numerology 
                        for assessing personality or events. These different schools of numerology give various methods for using numerology.</p>
